Some notes
==========
I just migrated the (companion code)[https://github.com/spazzarama/Direct3D-Rendering-Cookbook] to SharpDX 3.0 with some minor changes
mainly to the API changes from SharpDX.

I *haven't* checked most of the projects (but they compile).

You need to restore the nuget packages.
And you need the precompiled resources to run most of the samples.
